Weekends are lazy 😵 For both Recruiters & Job seekers. This week we shared 250+ QA Job notifications across all experience levels 🤘🏻 Being a Sunday , it makes no sense to forward the resume today. i.e. we won’t share any QA Job notification today 🙏🏻 Openings posted on Saturday-and-Sunday will be shared tomorrow (Monday). Monday morning should be a good time to share the resume. Let’s hope the coming week is more opportunistic & full of QA Job openings 👍🏻 Stay tuned & Happy Job


Sometimes we do get a message saying ‘rejected in last round’ or ‘Candidature is on hold’. It is unfortunate. It is rare that a recruiter comes back after the candidature is put on hold. But don’t get upset. At least you got an interview call and appeared. Just move on, keep learning and never settle until you join the next firm.


Why are you still looking for other offers? One typical Q every HR will ask. Be prepared. Have some pointers with what is lacking in the offer that you have received.

•	The offer is for a functional QA role, and I am looking for a better offer with automation as well.
•	The offered CTC is actually low as per my skills & work experience.
•	I don’t want to relocate. OR I would prefer a Company closer to my home.
•	I am trying for a Product-based organization instead of Service-based OR vice-versa.
•	Actually I am not going for all the interviews. XYZ is a big brand I would love to work with. Couldn’t ignore this interview call.

Closing statement can be - I am looking for a long-term commitment, so hunting for the best opportunity that I can get within the time I have in hand.
