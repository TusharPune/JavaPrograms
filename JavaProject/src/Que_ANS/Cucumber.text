JBehave is a framework for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). BDD is an evolution of test-driven development (TDD) and acceptance-test driven design, and is intended to make these practices more accessible and intuitive to newcomers and experts alike.

JBehave supports Java-based development, and plain English is used to form the story. The story comprises of one or more scenarios, and a scenario is made up of one or more steps. Kind of steps – ‘Given’, ‘When’, and ‘Then’, which are used in all BDD tools. The keywords in JBehave are,

Scenario, GivenStories, Given, When, Then, And.

Once BDD scenarios are defined, implement the steps via Java code.
