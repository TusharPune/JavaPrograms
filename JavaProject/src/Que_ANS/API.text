Q. Do you have working experience in an Agile environment? What's your Team composition?

A. We do follow Scrum methodology with 2-week sprints including Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, Demo sessions & Sprint reviews. The roles include,

• Product Owner: Champion for Business! The communication bridge b/w the team and stakeholders – writes customer-centric user stories, prioritize, maintains Product Backlog, Demo sessions, define releases, communicates team status, etc.
• Scrum Team: Champions for sustainable development & QA! Responsible for delivering potentially shippable increments of product at the end of each Sprint. A mix of software engineers, architects, programmers, analysts, QA experts, testers, and UI designers.
• Scrum Master: Champion for Scrum! Coach the team, the product owner, and the business on the scrum process and look for ways to fine-tune their practice of it.

Scrum team is the car, product owner - the driver and Scrum Master - the chief mechanic :-)
